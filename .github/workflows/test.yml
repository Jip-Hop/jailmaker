# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events for any branch
  push:
    branches: [ "**" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "**" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
