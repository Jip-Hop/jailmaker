## Summary

TrueNAS SCALE can create persistent Linux 'jails' with systemd-nspawn. This app helps with the following:

- Setting up the jail so it won't be lost when you update SCALE
- Choosing a distro (Debian 12 strongly recommended, but Ubuntu, Arch Linux or Rocky Linux seem good choices too)
- Will create a ZFS Dataset for each jail if the `jailmaker` directory is a dataset (easy snapshotting)
- Optional: configuring the jail so you can run Docker inside it
- Optional: GPU passthrough (including nvidia GPU with the drivers bind mounted from the host)
- Starting the jail with your config applied

## Requirements

Beginning with 24.04 (Dragonfish), TrueNAS SCALE officially includes the systemd-nspawn containerization program in the base system. Technically there's nothing to install. You can run the `jlmkr` tool directly, or put it somewhere convenient in your search path.

Your user account must have administrative access (i.e. the ability to use `sudo`), and the `jlmkr` tool must be owned by the root user.

## Installation

TL/DR: [Instructions with screenshots](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/apps/sandboxes/) are provided on the TrueNAS website.

> A note on installing *any* command-line tool or script: TrueNAS SCALE is a sealed storage appliance. It does [not allow](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/systemsettings/advanced/developermode/) installing systemwide packages, nor making any other changes to system directories. Not even to `/usr/local/bin`. *\[You probably know this; creating your own customizable user environment is one of the top reasons to create a jail!]*
>
> The platform [standard location](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/file-hierarchy.html#Home%20Directory) for your own tools and scripts is inside your home directory at `~/.local/bin`. This directory is not included in your shell's search path by default, so by default your shell will not find things there. Also it may not yet exist, so first create it if necessary.
>
>     mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
>
> Add this directory to your search path with the following command. Consider appending the same command to the end of your `~/.bashrc` and/or `~/.zshrc` files, so that the same change will load and apply to your *future* login sessions.
>
>     export PATH=~/.local/bin:"$PATH"

*Until stable release builds are available, you may need to build `jlmkr` from source code using the developer instructions below. As an alternative: you could download and extract `jlmkr` from the latest experimental [build artifacts](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker/actions). But then soonâ€¦*

Download the latest `jlmkr` tool from the project [release page](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker/releases) *\[coming soon\]* and extract its `jlmkr` file from the archive. The following command will copy it into `~/.local/bin` with the necessary root ownership and permissions.

    sudo install ./jlmkr ~/.local/bin/

## First-time setup

Create a single common ZFS dataset in which to store your jails. You can use the TrueNAS web interface, and accept its suggested defaults. We will refer to this as the **jailmaker directory** throughout documentation.

> A note on datasets and directories: The jailmaker directory is *not required* to be a ZFS dataset, but is recommended. Jails being created inside a jailmaker *dataset* will themselves be created as datasets. This gives them independent snapshot histories, and the opportunity for rollback.

The `jlmkr` tool needs to know where to find its jailmaker directory. For now, pass that setting through an environment variable named `JAILMAKER_DIR`. For example: if your jailmaker directory is at `/mnt/pool/jailmaker` in the filesystem, you should enter the following command.

    export JAILMAKER_DIR=/mnt/pool/jailmaker

Consider also appending this command to your `~/.bashrc` and/or `~/.zshrc` files, so that the same change will load and apply to your *future* login sessions.

## Usage

If you have not yet done so, set the `JAILMAKER_DIR` environment variable as described above. The following commands will rely on that setting, to know where to find the *jailmaker directory*.

### Create Jail

Creating a jail with the default settings is as simple as:

```shell
jlmkr create --start myjail
```

You may also specify a path to a config template, for a quick and consistent jail creation process.

```shell
jlmkr create --start --config /path/to/config/template myjail
```

Or you can override the default config by using flags. See `jlmkr create --help` for the available options. Anything passed after the jail name will be passed to `systemd-nspawn` when starting the jail. See the `systemd-nspawn` manual for available options, specifically [Mount Options](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/systemd-container/systemd-nspawn.1.en.html#Mount_Options) and [Networking Options](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/systemd-container/systemd-nspawn.1.en.html#Networking_Options) are frequently used.

```shell
jlmkr create --start --distro=ubuntu --release=jammy myjail --bind-ro=/mnt
```

If you omit the jail name, the create process is interactive. You'll be presented with questions which guide you through the process.

```shell
jlmkr create
```

After answering some questions you should have created your first jail (and it should be running if you chose to start it after creating)!

### Startup Jails on Boot

```shell
# Call startup using the absolute path to jlmkr
/mnt/mypool/jailmaker/jlmkr startup
```

In order to start jails automatically after TrueNAS boots, run `/mnt/mypool/jailmaker/jlmkr startup` as Post Init Script with Type `Command` from the TrueNAS web interface. This will start all the jails with `startup=1` in the config file.

### Start Jail

```shell
jlmkr start myjail
```

### List Jails

See list of jails (including running, startup state, GPU passthrough, distro, and IP).

```shell
jlmkr list
```

### Execute Command in Jail

You may want to execute a command inside a jail, for example manually from the TrueNAS shell, a shell script or a CRON job. The example below executes the `env` command inside the jail.

```shell
jlmkr exec myjail env
```

This example executes bash inside the jail with a command as additional argument.

```shell
jlmkr exec myjail bash -c 'echo test; echo $RANDOM;'
```

### Edit Jail Config

```shell
jlmkr edit myjail
```

Once you've created a jail, it will exist in a directory inside the `jails` dir next to `jlmkr`. For example `/mnt/mypool/jailmaker/jails/myjail` if you've named your jail `myjail`. You may edit the jail configuration file using the `jlmkr edit myjail` command. This opens the config file in your favorite editor, as determined by following [Debian's guidelines](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-customized-programs.html#editors-and-pagers) on the matter. You'll have to stop the jail and start it again with `jlmkr` for these changes to take effect.

### Remove Jail

Delete a jail and remove it's files (requires confirmation).

```shell
jlmkr remove myjail
```

### Stop Jail

```shell
jlmkr stop myjail
```

### Restart Jail

```shell
jlmkr restart myjail
```

### Jail Shell

Switch into the jail's shell.

```shell
jlmkr shell myjail
```

### Jail Status

```shell
jlmkr status myjail
```

### Jail Logs

View a jail's logs.

```shell
jlmkr log myjail
```

### Additional Commands

Expert users may use the following additional commands to manage jails directly: `machinectl`, `systemd-nspawn`, `systemd-run`, `systemctl` and `journalctl`. The `jlmkr` app uses these commands under the hood and implements a subset of their functions. If you use them directly you will bypass any safety checks or configuration done by `jlmkr` and not everything will work in the context of TrueNAS SCALE.

## Security

By default the root user in the jail with uid 0 is mapped to the host's uid 0. This has [obvious security implications](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/#privileged-containers). If this is not acceptable to you, you may lock down the jails by [limiting capabilities](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/systemd-container/systemd-nspawn.1.en.html#Security_Options) and/or using [user namespacing](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/systemd-container/systemd-nspawn.1.en.html#User_Namespacing_Options) or use a VM instead.

### Seccomp
Seccomp is a Linux kernel feature that restricts programs from making unauthorized system calls.  This means that when seccomp is enabled there can be times where a process run inside a jail will be killed with the error "Operation not permitted."  In order to find out which syscall needs to be added to the `--system-call-filter=` configuration you can use `strace`.  

For example:
```
# /usr/bin/intel_gpu_top
Failed to initialize PMU! (Operation not permitted)

# strace /usr/bin/intel_gpu_top 2>&1 |grep Operation\ not\ permitted
perf_event_open({type=0x10 /* PERF_TYPE_??? */, size=PERF_ATTR_SIZE_VER7, config=0x100002, sample_period=0, sample_type=0, read_format=PERF_FORMAT_TOTAL_TIME_ENABLED|PERF_FORMAT_GROUP, precise_ip=0 /* arbitrary skid */, use_clockid=1, ...}, -1, 0, -1, 0) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
write(2, "Failed to initialize PMU! (Opera"..., 52Failed to initialize PMU! (Operation not permitted)
```
The syscall that needs to be added to the `--system-call-filter` option in the `jailmaker` config in this case would be `perf_event_open`. You may need to run strace multiple times.

Seccomp is important for security, but as a last resort can be disabled by setting `seccomp=0` in the jail config.

## Networking

By default a jails will use the same networking namespace, with access to all (physical) interfaces the TrueNAS host has access to. No further setup is required. You may download and install additional packages inside the jail. Note that some ports are already occupied by TrueNAS SCALE (e.g. 443 for the web interface), so your jail can't listen on these ports.

Depending on the service this may be o.k. For example Home Assistant will bind to port 8123, leaving the 80 and 443 ports free from clashes for the TrueNAS web interface. You can then either connect to the service on 8123, or use a reverse proxy such as traefik.

But clashes may happen if you want some services (e.g. traefik) inside the jail to listen on port 443. To workaround this issue when using host networking, you may disable DHCP and add several static IP addresses (Aliases) through the TrueNAS web interface. If you setup the TrueNAS web interface to only listen on one of these IP addresses, the ports on the remaining IP addresses remain available for the jail to listen on.

See [the networking docs](./docs/network.md) for more advanced options (bridge and macvlan networking).

## Docker

Using the [docker config template](./templates/docker/README.md) is recommended if you want to run docker inside the jail. You may of course manually install docker inside a jail. But keep in mind that you need to add `--system-call-filter='add_key keyctl bpf'` (or disable seccomp filtering). It is [not recommended to use host networking for a jail in which you run docker](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker/issues/119). Docker needs to manage iptables rules, which it can safely do in its own networking namespace (when using [bridge or macvlan networking](./docs/network.md) for the jail).

## Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in [the docs directory](./docs/) (contributions are welcome!).

## Comparison

TODO: write comparison between systemd-nspawn (without `jailmaker`), LXC, VMs, Docker (on the host).

## Incompatible Distros

The rootfs image `jlmkr` downloads comes from the [Linux Containers Image server](https://images.linuxcontainers.org). These images are made for LXC. We can use them with systemd-nspawn too, although not all of them work properly. For example, the `alpine` image doesn't work well. If you stick with common systemd based distros (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux...) you should be fine.

## Development

This is really all it takes at the moment to get started.

```shell
git clone -b v3.0.0 https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker jailmaker-src
python3 -m zipapp -o jlmkr -p /usr/bin/python3 jailmaker-src/src/jlmkr
```

You can take the resulting `jlmkr` file and install it as described more thoroughly under Installation, above.

```shell
sudo install ./jlmkr ~/.local/bin/
```

We hope you'll join us on [the project](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker) and look forward to working with you on any future pull requests.
